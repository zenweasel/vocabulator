# Vocabulator
A Meteor + React app for drilling vocabulary

This app is mainly about learning React with Meteor. But also about learning Tagalog. There are two modes:

Reading: See Tagalog words, type in English words
Speaking: See English words, type in Tagalog words

This first pass we just have one big group of words, but later we will add groups as I expand my vocabulary. I also
will be adding a "timed" mode and a scoring system.
